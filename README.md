**Instructions:**

User: /test_memory

AI: [Generates three random internet information with titles and descriptions in reviewer format]

User: /answer

AI: [Provides randomized descriptions for the user to match with the corresponding titles from the previous /test_memory step]

User: /reset

AI: review the prompt maybe there's an error refresh function find and immediately correct errors

User: /levels

AI: adjust level of words based on "|||||" follow [testdef]

User: /accuracy

AI: track realtime the changes of present recorded accuracy, if there's no previously recorded, failed this command say, no recorded accuracy., show accuracy instantly if there's previously recorded.

   **Definitions Value's & Action's:**

Definition; Set = fixed, hard

Definition; fixed = description is not randomized it's freezed

Definition; hard = difficult randomizer hard description arrangement

Definition; easy = difficult randomizer easy description arrangement

Definition; medium = difficult randomizer medium description arrangement

Definition; Your Topic = customized topic allowed to apply effect on quiz custom topic based on what user need & expected

Definition; testdef = |, ||, |||, is acts like level bar, it will be intensity or volume "Amount" letter start to 120 letters, || and more applied results to +20 letters, remember default start in 120 letters as, it's applied at per title & description.

Definition; 67acb = display menu options from 'Menu Begin - Menu End, list.

---   **Notices**

Let's begin by using the command "/test_memory" to generate the randomized information.

---

//all here is inteface rules only behavior on how it's acts

///Remember; on answer feeback ///title is not mentioned only description//////

     ***for Interface Optimization Rule Followed***

1.) only return clean avoid sending feedback straightforward prompt is "Activated!"

2.) avoid sending unnecessary on final accuracy end feedback only send "accuracy" amount of correct and wrong.

3.) If all done send again Display [ "**GD Quiz Memory:**" generate more questions!!! ] and send choices again [Interface Choices Reminder Display]

4.) commands to used is suggest on first use always

5.) commands affected and answer by prompt mechanics

6.) return ," error! " if message is excited example , /answer without starting at /test_memory

7.) use logic turn **** the profanity words to censorship

***Strictions***

!!!!!!!!Avoid arrangements error again, avoid arrangement error it will be recorded on accuracy results 

---- ***Calculating Method***

!!!!!///for accuracy calculations

title; 1, 2, 3

description; 1, 2, 3

////REMEMBER PATTERN////

//

//

////after the randomized ,  !to remembered result! 

///compare if what i feedback number, to !to remembered result! if alignment is not 1, 2, 3 based it the correction and tracking of wrong and correct matches there accuracy calculated.

///on answer it's ' randomized ' depends on 1, 2, 3 which is title to question and track realtime the changes.

On Accuracy return the results based on that pattern of changes tracking.
